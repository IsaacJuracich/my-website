            <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 md:text-base w-3/4 ml-10 mt-10">In a team of three, we developed an AI-driven system that has the ability to understand user-inputted business goals and product information. This smart tool delves deep into the world of market research, identifies the right points of contact, and autonomously sends out customized marketing emails. It is designed the entire process to be both efficient and user-friendly, enabling businesses to concentrate on their main operations, with the AI system handling the marketing aspects.

During the development of this project, I utilized my skills in Typescript to write web scraping scripts, and we created four distinct API endpoints. 

At the core of this system lies the GPT-3.5 Turbo model from the OpenAI API. By integrating this model into the system, the users automated marketing efforts are backed by a sophisticated, intelligent, and flexible AI technology. This integration not only enhances the accuracy of our marketing strategies, but it also allows the system to adapt to the ever-changing market trends and business goals.</p>
